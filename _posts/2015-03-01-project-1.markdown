description: The objective was to attract tourists to visit Islands Brygge. We developed a concept that combines gamification and sharing economy in order to involve tourists in experiencing the area in a fun and active way. The concept leveraged on the impact of social media and mobile storytelling, and allowed tourists to share their experiences with their peers in order to create a network effect.
